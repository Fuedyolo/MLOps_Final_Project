# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

### Week 1

* [x] Create a git repository
* [x] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
* [x] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
* [x] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
* [x] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
* [x] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
* [x] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
* [x] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project

## Group information

### Question 1
> **Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk>**
>
> Answer:

27

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Example:
>
> *sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX*
>
> Answer:

s183951, s173853, s212804

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

We choose to work with the pytorch geometric framework, from where we got both the dataset and the model framework. The framework itself actually complicated the project a bit as a lot of the time was used on dependency issues and installation requirements that did not work. However the framework itself worked just fine once installed and we were able to create, train and predict using a model from the framework. We got the data from the Dataset class of pytorch-geometric. We used many of the frameworks taught in the course such as wandb, docker, github actions and gcp. We did not use any frameworks not taught in the course. 

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used conda to install and manage our dependencies. All the required dependencies can be downloaded and installed by using either the requirements.txt if installing with pip, or using the environment.yml if installing with conda. In both cases a fresh environment should be setup. Furthermore if installing with pip a new user might be required to install the packages torch-sparse and torch-scatter seperatly. For the latter packages to work a windows user would have to install visual studio build tools to get a c/c++ compiler. The list of dependecies was created with the pipreqs package that automatically scans the projectfolder for the used packages.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

The vast majority of the code is found in the src_2 folder, the rests of the folders should be self explanatory which is one of the benefits of cookiecutter. We removed the folders notebooks, models and src, and added the src_2 folder instead. This was done because as creating a new environment and automatically installing all the packages with either conda or pip would create a src folder that would interfere with the import statements within the source folder. We added a tests folder containing a few unit tests. The yml files and the dockerfile(s) was added directly to the root of the project. The models created are in the outputs folder. 

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

We didn't implement any rules for code quality or format but we did follow the pep8 standard and used both flake8 and black throughout the process as to keep everything fairly organised. This makes it easier when multiple people are contributing to a project as the code should be more readable. Also when complying to a standard there is less probability for errors. (https://standards.ieee.org/beyond-standards/what-are-standards-why-are-they-important/)

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

we implemented 3 different tests, one for the training part of the model and two for the dataset part, just to ensure that the data entered is valid. Further a tests was implemented to make sure that the trained model was not empty. This was done such that there is an actual training (for 1 epoch) and the model outcome of that training is used to check wheter or not the model contain parameters. 

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

--- question 8 fill here ---

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

We made use of branches in the project, primarily so that each person could work on their own branch as to not interfere with the work of the others. Pull requests were then used to merge the branches. 

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

We did not make use of dvc as the dataset was a part of the package that was also used to create the network. Thus the data never changed and nothing new was added to the data. Therefor data version control did not make sense in this project. However if the project was using data that might change and it could be usefull to capture which version of the data that was used in a given commit to github. 

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink>*

--- question 11 fill here ---

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We used a simple argparser for the predict model script which can be called with: python src_2/models/predict_model.py outputs\2023-01-13\21-47-22\trained_model.pt data\processed\dataset.pt The two paths specified is the path to the model and the path to the dataset. The training script can simply be called with python src_2/models/train_model.py, however wandb is used and the user is prompted the 3 standard wandb options. The application created with fastapi also needs a parameter which is the dataset, and with that it gives the accuracy for the model we trained. 

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

We used config files such that each run of the model would create a hydra folder with a config.yaml file which indicitas the settings used for that run, eg. epochs, learning rate etc. 


### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words + 1 to 3 screenshots.
>
> Example:
> *As seen in the first image when have tracked ... and ... which both inform us about ... in our experiments.*
> *As seen in the second image we are also tracking ... and ...*

### Question 15

> **Docker is an important tool for creating containerized applications. Explain how you used docker in your**
> **experiments? Include how you would run your docker images and include a link to one of your docker files.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *For our project we developed several images: one for training, inference and deployment. For example to run the*
> *training docker image: `docker run trainer:latest lr=1e-3 batch_size=64`. Link to docker file: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

We used docker mostly to get the different part of the project to work with gcp. We used the docker image to both train the project on gcp but also to deploy a function with cloud run. The first docker image is run by simply docker run <name> trainer:latest. The second docker image is run by the same command and by specifying which port the user wants to be able to run the application on. 

### Question 16

> **When running into bugs while trying to run your experiments, how did you perform debugging? Additionally, did you**
> **try to profile your code or do you think it is already perfect?**

## Working in the cloud

> In the following section we would like to know more about your experience when developing in the cloud.

### Question 17

> **List all the GCP services that you made use of in your project and shortly explain what each service does?**
>
> Answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

We used the following services: Compute Engine, cloud trigger, cloud run, vertex ai and container registry. Compute Engine was used to create the a VM, the specifications of the VM was similar to the ones used in the course. The container registry was used to store the image that was created from the dockerfile. Cloud triggers was used to automatically create the new container image when the main branch of the github repo was updated (this was disabled most of the time as new docker images were not needed) Cloud run was used to deploy a simple app that let the user input a datapoint and then predict the output. Vertex ai was used to do model training. 
### Question 18

> **The backbone of GCP is the Compute engine. Explained how you made use of this service and what type of VMs**
> **you used?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.

> *We used the compute engine to run our ... . We used instances with the following hardware: ... and we started the*
> *using a custom container: ...*
>
> Answer:

We used the compute engine to create the instance we used for almost all other gcp feautres in this project. The following hardware was used: 
Machine type: n1-standard-1
CPU platform: Intel Haswell
Architecture: x86/64
### Question 19

> **Insert 1-2 images of your GCP bucket, such that we can see what data you have stored in it.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/bucket.png).**
>
> Answer:

We did not use GCP buckets as the dataset was stored within the torch-geometric package and therefor available to everyone with the package.

### Question 20

> **Upload one image of your GCP container registry, such that we can see the different images that you have stored.**
> **You can take inspiration from [this figure](figures/registry.png).**
